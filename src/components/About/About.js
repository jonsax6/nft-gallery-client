          A zyzygy is a rare fleeting moment in a gravitational system where 3
          celestial bodies come into perfect alignment. The best known examples
          of a zyzygy are the solar and lunar eclipses. Zyzygy Art is an art
          gallery. Why are we naming our art gallery Zyzygy? We believe we are
          at the intersection point where two worlds are coming into alignment -
          the digital world of blockchain technology, with the digital scarcity
          we can achieve through non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and the real world
          of tangible scarcity like art, real estate, and property rights.&nbsp;

          Our vision at Zyzygy Art is to allow for the sale of art, and the
          ownership rights to that art to be deployed to a public blockchain
          such as ethereum. The transfer of ownership at any point in the future
          will be done by transferring this NFT to the new owner of that art.
          Built into that NFT contract is a royalty structure, and all the
          identifying information about the art piece itself. The artist and
          curator will receive royalties automatically when the art is bought
          and sold at any point, in perpetuity, as structured into the NFT
          contract. In other words, the code is law, and it is impossible to
          alter it once deployed to the blockchain. The art pieces will have a
          cryptographic QR code embedded into it which will display the NFT
          smart contract address as well as the token ID for that specific piece
          of artwork.

          For example Zyzygy Art sells an art piece created by Bob. Jane
          buys this art piece from Zyzygy Art with Ethereum (a popular
          crypto-currency with NFT and smart contract capability) and the
          transaction transfers the bill of sale to Jane, who now controls the
          ownership of Bob&apos;s art. The studio receives a royalty and initial
          percentage for the first sale. At some point in the future, Jane
          decides to liquidate some of her physical assets to buy some real
          estate, so she auctions Bob&rsquo;s art. Bob&apos;s art has
          appreciated in value significantly, so Jane will make a nice profit!
          Steve, the winner of the auction, will send Jane the amount of
          ethereum required to make the purchase, and when that ethereum is
          transferred to Jane, a small percentage will be automatically sent to
          Bob&apos;s ethereum address to cover his contractually agreed-upon
          royalty. And if Steve decides to auction Bob&apos;s art in the future,
          Bob and Zyzygy will again receive their royalties.

          If it&apos;s also coded into the smart contract, Zyzygy Art can
          receive a small royalty either as a taper-off, or also in perpetuity.
          This can be decided when the contract is deployed to the blockchain
          and the NFT is minted.

          There are however a few technical issues that need to be solved in
          order to prevent counterfeiting. There is nothing stopping someone
          from creating a copy of the art, and placing the same QR code on the
          counterfeit art piece. So the authenticity of the artwork will still
          need to be verified by 3rd parties. Until a foolproof system for this
          can be created, authenticity will either be on an honor code system,
          or need to be verified by an expert. However, it would be impossible
          for the counterfeiter to sell that art using the blockchain because
          they will not have access to or control over the ownership token
          (NFT). In order to &quot;game the system&quot;, they would have to not
          only make an identical copy of the actual artwork, but also successfully
          hack the ethereum network, which is virtually impossible to do. So it
          really is almost foolproof and cannot be gamed. If the
          sale of the artwork remains on the blockchain, then ownership cannot
          be faked by a 3rd party. The blockchain will have an immutable
          ownership record, and only the current owner&apos;s ethereum wallet
          will be able to transfer ownership to a buyer. If the artist is well
          known, and their work has value and notoriety, then it should also be
          common knowledge in the art world that ownership is controlled by the
          NFT, and the NFT contract address would be public record and fully
          transparent, so selling the counterfeit art for regular &apos;ol
          dollars won&apos;t really work out very well for the counterfeiter.
